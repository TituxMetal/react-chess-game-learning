## Description, Context and Goals

Chess Game Learning is an interactive web-based educational platform that teaches chess fundamentals
through a story-driven, chapter-by-chapter learning experience. The application serves as a
comprehensive chess tutorial system, guiding learners from absolute beginner level through
intermediate concepts using structured, progressive content delivery.

The platform is designed to organize chess education into 6 major learning modules containing 28+
lessons:

1. Introduction to Chess (3 chapters)
2. How Pieces Move (6 chapters)
3. Basic Rules and Strategy (5 chapters)
4. Essential Tactics (5 chapters)
5. Basic Endgames (5 chapters)
6. Opening Fundamentals (5 chapters)

**Current Challenge:** The existing story content contains multiple incoherences and requires
complete rewriting to ensure educational quality, consistency, and proper learning progression. The
platform infrastructure exists, but all educational content must be recreated with coherent
narrative flow, accurate chess instruction, and appropriate difficulty progression.

Each module will use narrative-style markdown content with interactive chess board demonstrations,
progress tracking, and intuitive navigation to create an engaging self-paced learning environment
for chess enthusiasts.

### Deployment Intent

MVP for personal use - no public deployment planned. This is a learning project focused on building
a functional chess education platform for personal development and experimentation.

### Context

This chess learning application addresses the need for an interactive, self-paced educational
platform that makes chess accessible to French-speaking beginners. Traditional chess learning
methods often rely on static books or videos that lack interactivity and immediate feedback.

**Target Audience:**

- Absolute chess beginners (ages 12+)
- French-speaking learners seeking structured chess education
- Self-motivated learners who prefer interactive, story-driven content
- Individuals wanting to learn chess fundamentals at their own pace

**Learning Philosophy:**

- Story-driven narrative approach to make chess concepts memorable
- Progressive difficulty with immediate feedback
- Interactive chess board demonstrations for visual learning
- Gamified progress tracking to maintain engagement

**Technical Context:**

- Built as a modern React web application with TypeScript
- Utilizes chess.js for accurate chess logic and validation
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile learning
- Offline-capable for uninterrupted learning sessions

### Goals

**Primary Goals:**

1. **Educational Excellence**: Provide comprehensive chess education from absolute beginner to
   intermediate level through 28+ structured lessons
2. **Interactive Learning**: Create engaging, hands-on learning experiences with immediate feedback
   and visual demonstrations
3. **Progress Tracking**: Implement robust progress tracking to motivate learners and provide clear
   learning paths
4. **Accessibility**: Make chess education accessible to French-speaking audiences with intuitive
   navigation and clear explanations

**Success Metrics:**

- **Completion Rate**: 70%+ of users complete at least one full story module
- **Engagement**: Average session duration of 15+ minutes per chapter
- **Learning Effectiveness**: Users can demonstrate understanding through interactive questions with
  80%+ accuracy
- **User Experience**: Smooth navigation between chapters with <2 second load times

**Long-term Vision:**

- Expand to additional languages (English, Spanish)
- Add advanced tactics and strategy modules
- Implement multiplayer practice games
- Create community features for learner interaction
