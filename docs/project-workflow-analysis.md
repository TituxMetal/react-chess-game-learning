# Project Workflow Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-08 **Project:** Chess Game Learning **Analyst:** TituxMetal

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** Web application
- **Project Level:** Level 2 (Small complete system)
- **Instruction Set:** instructions-med.md

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** Interactive chess learning web application with story-based tutorial
  system. Features chapter-by-chapter navigation, progress tracking, and educational content
  delivery across 6 major learning modules (Introduction, Piece Moves, Basic Rules, Essential
  Tactics, Basic Endgames, Opening Fundamentals).
- **Estimated Stories:** 10-15 stories
- **Estimated Epics:** 1-2 epics
- **Timeline:** 4-8 weeks (small team)

### Context

- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** Brownfield (existing codebase with AI-generated code requiring
  refactoring)
- **Existing Documentation:** None
- **Team Size:** Solo developer or small team (1-3 developers)
- **Deployment Intent:** Web deployment (educational platform)

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

1. **PRD.md** - Product Requirements Document

   - Market context and user needs
   - Feature specifications
   - Success metrics
   - User stories

2. **Tech-spec.md** - Technical Specification (via 3-solutioning workflow)

   - Architecture decisions
   - Component design
   - Data models
   - Implementation approach

### Workflow Sequence

1. Complete PRD using instructions-med.md
2. Hand off to 3-solutioning workflow for technical architecture
3. Generate tech-spec.md with implementation details
4. Optional: Code refactoring plan for existing messy codebase

### Next Actions

1. Begin PRD creation with focus on:

   - User personas (chess learners at different skill levels)
   - Core learning journey and content delivery
   - Progress tracking and persistence
   - Interactive chess components and visualizations

2. After PRD completion, invoke 3-solutioning workflow for:

   - Clean architecture recommendations
   - Refactoring strategy for existing code
   - Component reorganization
   - State management approach

## Special Considerations

- **Code Quality Issues:** Current codebase described as "messy AI-generated code"

  - PRD should include code quality and maintainability as success criteria
  - Tech spec phase should address refactoring strategy
  - Consider technical debt documentation

- **Educational Content:** 28+ lesson chapters already exist

  - Content structure is already defined in stories/index.json
  - Focus PRD on delivery mechanism and user experience
  - Progress tracking and learning path optimization

- **Technology Stack:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, chess.js, react-chessboard

  - Modern stack with good testing infrastructure (Vitest)
  - Nanostores for state management
  - React Router for navigation

## Technical Preferences Captured

- **Frontend Framework:** React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS 4.x
- **Chess Logic:** chess.js library
- **Chess UI:** react-chessboard component
- **State Management:** Nanostores (@nanostores/react)
- **Routing:** React Router v7
- **Testing:** Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Code Quality:** ESLint with TypeScript support
